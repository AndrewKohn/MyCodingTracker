# MyCodingTracker

## About This Application
Simple timer to count the amount of time spent actively coding.  This timer should not be spent on solely browsing videos, podcasts, books, & etc even if they're related.

### Coding Timer.txt
The Coding Timer.txt file can be located in the user's documents folder.  If the file is not present, it will be created upon starting the application.
example directory: C:\Users\user\Documents\Coding Timer.txt

## Purpose
The main purpose of this program was to see what my coding habit looks like.  The secondary purpose was to understand and implement Java Swing gui.

## Things to do:
  1. Find a way to have a dynamic/updating timer within the JFrame/JPanel.
  2. Change app icon (currently not very visually appealing, but gets the job done).
  3. Add method to summate all session totals and write to top of file.
  4. Start learning JavaFX and make a better looking GUI.
  5. Create a secondary view that shows a calendar and tallies up the total daily amounts.
